                If you wanna run away with me <br>
                I know a galaxy <br>
                And I can take you for a ride <br>
                I had a premonition that we fell <br>
                Into a rhythm <br>
                Where the music don't stop for life <br>
                Glitter in the sky <br>
                Glitter in my eyes <br>
                Shining just the way I like <br>
                If you feelin' like you need a little bit of company <br>
                You met me at the perfect time

                I believe that you're for me <br>
                I feel it in our energy <br>
                I see us written in the stars <br>
                We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never <br>
                Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far <br>
                Glitter in the sky <br>
                Glitter in our eyes <br>
                Shining just the way we are <br>
                I feel like we're forever, every time we get together <br>
                But whatever, let's get lost on Mars
